## ⚠️ Disclaimer

🚧 This project is a work-in-progress and is not ready for production yet. Use at your own risk. 🚧

## 📖 About

This crate contains an implementation of a Patricia Tree.

Its structure is implemented to match Ethereum's [Patricia Merkle Trees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/).

## 🚀 Usage

Here's an example to calculate the hash after inserting some key values.

```rust
use merkle_patricia_tree::PatriciaMerkleTree;
use sha3::Keccak256;

let mut tree = PatriciaMerkleTree::<&[u8], &[u8], Keccak256>::new();
tree.insert(b"doe", b"reindeer");
tree.insert(b"dog", b"puppy");
tree.insert(b"dogglesworth", b"cat");

let hash = tree.compute_hash().unwrap();
println!("{:x}", hash)
```

### Testing

Run the following command:

```
make test
```

## 📊 Benchmarking

```
make bench
```

Benchmarks are provided for the following use cases:

  - Retrieval of non-existant nodes.
  - Retrieval of existing nodes.
  - Insertion of new nodes.
  - Overwriting nodes.
  - Removal of nodes.
  - Removal of non-existing nodes (no-op).

Every use case is tested with different tree sizes, ranging from 1k to 1M.

On a AMD Ryzen 9 5950x 3.4 Ghz with 128 Gb RAM using `Keccak256` as the hash function:

| Bench | 1k | 10k | 100k | 1M |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|----|
| get() | `38.287 ns` | `58.692 ns` | `118.90 ns` | `266.56 ns` |
| insert() | `327.44 ns` | `407.50 ns` | `778.76 ns` | `1.6858 µs` |

## 📚 Documentation

### What is a patricia merke tree

PATRICIA is an acronym which means:

Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric

> A compact representation of a trie in which any node that is an only child is merged with its parent. 

> Patricia tries are seen as radix trees with radix equals 2, which means that each bit of the key is compared individually and each node is a two-way (i.e., left versus right) branch

In essence, a patricia tree stores a value for the given key (also named **path**).

The key or path is converted to bytes, and then each nibble of each byte is used to traverse the tree.

It is composed of 3 different types of nodes:

#### The branch node

It contains a 17 element array:
- The 16 first elements cover every representable value of a nibble (2^4 = 16)
- The value in case the path is fully traversed.

#### The leaf node

It contains 2 elements:
- The encoded path.
- The value.

#### The extension node

It contains 2 elements:
- The encoded path.
- A key or path for the next lookup.

This node allows the tree to be more compact, imagine we have a path that ultimately can only go 1 way, because it has no diverging paths,
adding X nodes instead of 1 representing that would be a waste of space, this fixes that.

For example, imagine we have the keys "abcdx" and "abcdy", instead of adding 10 nodes (1 for each nibble in each character), we create a single node representing the path "abcd", thus compressing the tree.


#### Solving the ambiguity

Since traversing a path is done through it's nibbles, when doing so, the remaining partial path may have an odd number of nibbles left, this
introduces an ambiguity that comes from storing a nibble as a byte:

Imagine we have the following remaining nibbles:

- `1`
- `01`

When representing both as a byte, they have the same value `1`.

Thats why a flag is introduced to differenciate between an odd or even remaining partial path:

| hex char | bits | node type | path length |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 0        | 0000 | extension | even        |
| 1        | 0001 | extension | odd         |
| 2        | 0010 | leaf      | even        |
| 3        | 0011 | leaf      | odd         |

```
[flag] + path
```

### Terms Used
- **[nibble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble)**: 4bits, half a byte, a single hex digit.
